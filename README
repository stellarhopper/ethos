Project 'Ethos'
===============

'Ethos' plausibly stands for Event Tracker's Home of Open Source.
It is a standalone, open implementation of software that can run on the
Raspberry Pi in a TBS Event Tracker Unit.

It does not aim to be a full race management solution - there is plenty of
software that already does this well. A future goal is developing an open
communication protocol that will enable this and other similar projects to
plug-and-play with existing software like LiveTime.


Setup Instructions
==================

1. Remove and safely store the original SD card somewhere :)
2. Install Raspbian on a fresh SD card, and insert it into the pi.
3. SSH into it, use apt-get upgrade to get the latest latest everything.
4. apt-get install git
5. Install wiringPi: http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/
6. Clone this project.
7. Build and install it (See build instructions)
8. TBD


External API
============

Project Ethos will implement an external API to interface with race
management software such as LiveTime or LapSync. The API specification
can be found at:

Contributing
============

Github pull requests are welcome. Make an issue to discuss a feature
or its implementation details before starting on something major
if you'd like.

If you'd rather not use Github, emailed patches are fine too.

We follow the Linux kernel coding style, which can be found at:
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/Documentation/process/coding-style.rst
(The parts that are applicable of course).
